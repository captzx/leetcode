**136. Single Number**

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
```
Example 1:
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

* 异或^, [wa~ nice]
* 用map, 能解决问题, 但使用了额外空间
