**160 Intersection of Two Linked Lists**

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

```
For example, the following two linked lists:

A:          a1 → a2
                   K
                     c1 → c2 → c3
                   J            
B:     b1 → b2 → b3
begin to intersect at node c1.
```
